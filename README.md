# Follow the Keys - Interactive Piano Game  
**Generative Music & Hand Gesture Interaction**  

Follow the Keys is an interactive game that blends generative music with hand gesture tracking. The game uses real-time webcam input to detect the position of your index finger and lets you control a virtual piano. Your objective is to follow a sequence of musical notes and tap the corresponding keys in the correct order to progress through the levels. As the game advances, the sequence of notes grows longer, making the game more challenging.
